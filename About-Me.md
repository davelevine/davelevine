# Introduction

---------------------------
I'm a father, husband, analyst, system administrator, minimalist, technical writer, musician and lifter of weights. I also build complex distributed systems and write about it.

## Interests

---------------------------
My interests can be reduced nicely to the following:

* Learning something well enough to truly understand it, then capture and document it.
* Personal growth and well-being.
* Sharing and discussing with others.

I spend a fair amount of time reading and learning as much as I can. I think the most important thing anyone can do is pass knowledge along to someone else. Although I don't teach professionally, I enjoy sharing information and having thoughtful discussion whenever possible.

Some topics of interest include system design, homelab, network security, self improvement, cloud computing and most recently, fatherhood.
